# Sharing-Platform-for-Students
As part of a course in information systems analysis and design, we created a collaborative system designed for students from all academic institutions that allows for the uploading and sharing of solutions to questions, homework assignments, and tests.

The goal of the system is to provide an efficient and convenient platform for sharing knowledge, raising questions, and receiving solutions in a fast and focused manner.

| Topic                               | Current Situation                                                                 | With the System                                                                                                  |

| Registration to the system          | There is no system to register to                                                 | Registration will be required to use the system. As part of the process, the student will provide their academic institution and connect it for transferring course information. |
| Uploading questions and solutions   | Sending messages in WhatsApp groups, emails to lecturers, responses only at certain times | A centralized database of questions and solutions within the system.                                              |
| Search in the system                | Searching on Google, searching in WhatsApp by topic                               | Questions will be organized by categories and topics. Search will be possible using keywords, topic, or upload date. |
| Automatic notifications on uploads  | Students need to ask others if they solved the same exercise/test                 | The student who uploaded a question will receive a personal notification for each solution added. Additionally, students can set personal preferences for notifications (e.g., by specific course). |
| AI-based system for inconsistency detection | It is not possible to know if there are contradictions between answers, manual comparison is required | The system will detect contradictions between solutions and alert both students and the system administrator (who will ensure one correct answer). It will also detect spam in uploaded questions and raise alerts accordingly. |
