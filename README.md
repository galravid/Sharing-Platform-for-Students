# Sharing-Platform-for-Students
As part of a course in information systems analysis and design, we created a collaborative system designed for students from all academic institutions that allows for the uploading and sharing of solutions to questions, homework assignments, and tests.
The goal of the system is to provide an efficient and convenient platform for sharing knowledge, raising questions, and receiving solutions in a fast and focused manner.
